# Portfolio

### Fridas Portfolio
(Milestone Project 1 for Code Institute)

This is a website created for Frida Lindstrom to showcase her skills and previous work as a Full Stack Web Developer. The goal of the website is to connect site owner with possible employers to get hired.

## UX

### User Stories

-   As a user I want the site to be easily navigated and the information provided easily understood.
-   As a user I want to easily find the wanted information about Frida, download her cv och or the means to contact her. 

### Site Owners Stories

 - As a site owner I want the user to easily navigate the site and locate the information they seek. 
 - As a site owner I want to show myself in best light possible to get hired by potential employers visiting the site.

## Design

Home Page layout consisting of a hero-image, following a white background with black font throughout for the following sections.  
The color scheme continues on the colors of blue and yellow found in the hero-image to keep the colors and light theme of the site consistent throughout.

### Content

All content was written by the developer.

### Code 

- Tutorial help and code for contact-form from w3schools, view tutorial [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp)

- Information, help and code for media queries was found at css.tricks, view [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)

- As the developer I have chosen to base the website entirely on Html and CSS  (without Bootstrap) to focus solely on learning to build a website based on CSS Flexbox since I felt inadequate in my skillset in CSS and wanted to learn the base of CSS before adding and relying too heavily on Bootstrap. To learn more of Flexbox I have used this [ video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTlczfR82mQ&list=PLDyQo7g0_nsUjf046cCHKJ16U1SoXrElZ&index=6) from Youtube to gain better understanding and knowledge along with this [article tutorial]([https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)) from css-tricks.com.
